# The vim reaper 0.1, June 2006

# vim has a bad habit of chewing up a ton of CPU if user
# backgrounds it, closes their terminal window, or gets
# disconnected from the net with a vim session open. We
# don't want to kill currently active vim sessions, but we do want
# to kill them if user owns the process but is not logged in.
# Run vimreaper as root from a cron job.

# Get list (as a string) of logged in users
logged_in=$(who -q | head -1)

# Get a list of vim sessions and their users. 
# Exclude the root user and the return for the grep process itself.
# Loop through returned lines. Test whether owner of process is currently logged in.
# If not, reap.

ps aux | grep vim | grep -v "grep" | grep -v "root" | awk '{print $1 "\t"  $2}' |
while read line; do
	user=$(echo "$line" | cut -f1)
	pid=$(echo "$line" | cut -f2)

	# Is this vim user logged in?
	if  ! echo "$logged_in" | grep "$user" ; then
		 kill -9 $pid
	fi
done
